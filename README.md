[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge.svg)](https://tutorial.optaas.mindfoundry.ai)

[OPTaaS](https://mindfoundry.ai/optaas) (Optimization as a Service) is a general-purpose Bayesian optimizer developed
by [Mind Foundry](https://mindfoundry.ai) which provides optimal hyper-parameter configurations via web-services.
It can handle any parameter type and does not need to know the underlying process, models, or data.

This repository contains tutorials and examples in the form of Jupyter Notebooks, which demonstrate how OPTaaS can help 
you solve problems using Bayesian Optimization.

You can install the [OPTaaS Python Client](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/mindfoundry-optaas-client) by simply running:
`pip install mindfoundry-optaas-client`
